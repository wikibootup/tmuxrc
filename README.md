# Tmuxrc

### Issues

- tmux copy to clipboard not working in OS X

```sh
$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
```

- if TPM(Tmux Plugin Manager) was not installed,

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

- Mouse mode
  - If you want normal mouse block & copy in Iterm, use `Option`, or try `Shift` in other environments.
